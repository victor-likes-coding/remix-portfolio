            years old aspiring software developer. I was born right here in the
            U.S. and have been coding mostly in JS for the better part of 6
            years (more or less). I recently picked up TypeScript a couple years
            ago and have been loving it ever since. I'm a gamer when I'm not
            writing code.

            I do enjoy a good binge of anime or some tv show. I really enjoy
            Isekai animes. I don't really like social media except for TikTok
            and it's mostly to consume social media not make content.

            wanting to get a job in SWE. It's to be able to get her a big house
            and a brother/sister companion. I've sort of been slacking trying to
            get a job in this field for a while now, but I'm fairly confident
            that I'll be able to land one soon.
